// Bulk expert streamer for prefill.
//
// Prefill is not a caching workload. With T tokens in a micro-batch the distinct
// experts per layer is ~512*(1-(1-10/512)^T) -- at T=256 that is 509 of 512 -- so
// essentially the whole expert tensor is needed, once, and then never again until
// the next micro-batch. Faulting it in 4 KiB at a time through mmap measures
// 0.13 GB/s. Reading the same bytes contiguously in 16 MB chunks measures 7.0-9.7.
//
// So: host staging filled by a handful of large sequential reads, and the MoE
// graph's expert tensors point into it (or into its device mirror). The decode
// cache is left completely alone.
//
// With overlap on there are two host staging buffers and a reader thread: while
// layer L uploads and computes out of one buffer, layer L+1's read streams into
// the other. The read is most of a prefill layer's wall time, so hiding it is
// worth the second buffer -- which is allocated up front, before the expert RAM
// tier sizes itself, so the memory guard accounts for it.
