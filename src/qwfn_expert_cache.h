// Three-tier routed-expert cache.
//
// The model activates 10 of 512 experts on each of 48 layers, so one generated
// token touches 480 expert blocks -- about 1.05 GB of quantized weights out of
// a 55.8 GB expert set. At the 15 tok/s target that is ~15.8 GB/s of demand.
//
// Nothing holds 55.8 GB here, so the cache is what makes the target reachable:
//   T0  VRAM   ~4.7 GB free after the dense core, KV and vision  (~2,100 experts)
//   T1  RAM    ~19 GB                                            (~8,700 experts)
//   T2  NVMe   everything else, read at slice granularity over io_uring
//
// Routing is strongly skewed: a 23 GB page cache over 55.8 GB of experts was
// measured serving ~94% of activations, so a managed cache with frequency-based
// admission should do at least as well.
//
// Misses may optionally be served from a second, more aggressively quantized
// checkpoint (UD-IQ1_S): a cold expert then costs ~0.96 MB instead of ~2.18 MB.
// Quality loss is confined to rarely-routed experts. The handle reports the
// ggml_type actually obtained so the caller dequantizes correctly.
