// qwfn_template -- the chat framing, in one place.
//
// Shared by qwfn-chat and qwfn-server so the two cannot drift. Everything here
// follows the template embedded in the GGUF (tokenizer.chat_template), not a
// guess at it. Two details it is easy to get wrong:
//
//   * The generation prompt pre-fills the model INTO the think block:
//     "<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n". Turning thinking off means emitting a
//     pre-closed "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", not omitting the block.
//   * Reasoning effort is not a sampler knob -- it is a system message the
//     template injects. xhigh (the template's own default) and low carry text;
//     medium deliberately carries none.
